# 🧠 Multi-Class Classification using PyTorch

This repository showcases a complete pipeline for multi-class classification using PyTorch. It walks through data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and visualization—all within a single, well-documented Jupyter notebook.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to classify structured tabular data into multiple categories using a feedforward neural network. The notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a model that generalizes well across unseen samples.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model definition and training  
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn**: Label encoding, train-test split, and evaluation metrics  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization of training performance and confusion matrix  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and experimentation  

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Accepts numerical features from tabular data  
- **Hidden Layers**: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activation  
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multi-class prediction  
- **Loss Function**: `CrossEntropyLoss` for multi-class classification  
- **Optimizer**: `Adam` with learning rate tuning  

## 📊 Results

- ✅ **Validation Accuracy**: ~85%  
- 📉 **Loss Curve**: Smooth convergence across training epochs  
- 📈 **Confusion Matrix**: Strong class separation with minimal overlap  
- 🔍 **Generalization**: Model performs well on unseen data
